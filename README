This is your new Play 2.1 application
=====================================

This "supersimple" application is created only to verify that the Play2 plugin is working properly. 

This has been tested (and failed) with the following setup: 

This is what I do: 
1. Download the latest Juno release: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/junosr2
2. Install the Scala IDE (for Scala 2.10 and Eclise Juno) : http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e38/scala210/stable/site (according to the info on this page: http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html)
3. Install the Scala IDE Play 2 plugin: http://download.scala-ide.org/play2/nightly_3.0-M_juno_2.10-M/site/  (according to the info on this page: https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide-play2/wiki)
4. Creating a Play 2.1 JAVA project - and getting it ready for Eclipse ( $play eclipse) .
5. Checking to "add Scala nature" according to the known issues of the Scala-IDE-play2 plugin: https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide-play2/wiki/Known-Problems
